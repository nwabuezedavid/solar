          <p>
            CSR refers to the way in which businesses regulate themselves to ensure that their activities positively impact society. CSR policies aim to guarantee that companies work ethically, considering human rights, as well as the social, economic, and environmental impacts of their business operations. Companies should meet, and aim to exceed, any relevant legislation, and where legislation is not available, the company should follow best practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            RCILtd is committed to ensuring that all business undertakings are carried out ethically by adhering to this policy.
